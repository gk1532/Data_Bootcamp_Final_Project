# Project Description

AN ANALYSIS OF  FACTORS AFFECTING ENERGY CONSUMPTION ACROSS THE GLOBE: Using publically available data from the world bank, we analyze various factors that may contribute to/or may be indicators of the level of energy consumption expected in a country around the globe. We use Python to source and clean up the data, following which a regression analysis is performed on the data set to determine the predictive value of various independent variables towards determining the independent variable, energy consumption. Further analysis is conducted to break up the selection of countries into high, middle, and low income brackets in an effort to identify how the importance of each variable may change in each cohort of countries.
